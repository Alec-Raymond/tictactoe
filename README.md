## TICTACTOE GAME

This tictactoe uses nodejs and express to create a REST API that can store and play games of tictactoe.

You can:

* get tictactoe games
* get a singular tictactoe game
* post a new tictactoe game
* put a move onto a tictactoe board when following the tictactoe rules
* delete a game of tictactoe

This program stores the tictactoe games as .json files on your system using the node fs module.

In the future, a different branch on this repository will use the node module sequelize in order to store the tictactoe games.
